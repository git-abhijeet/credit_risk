# Intelligent Credit Risk Assessment & Loan Recovery Platform

## The Challenge

**FinFlow Lending**, a digital lending platform processing over 10,000 loan applications monthly, faces a dual crisis: its traditional credit scoring misses 40% of creditworthy applicants who lack conventional credit history. In contrast, their loan recovery rate sits at just 65%. This results in:

- **$3.5 million** in annual losses from defaults
- **$2 million** in missed revenue from false rejections
- **45% higher** collection costs due to inefficient recovery workflows

The platform needs an intelligent system to assess non-traditional credit signals, predict default risks in real-time, and automate personalized recovery strategies.

## Your Mission

Build a **production-ready project** that revolutionizes both credit assessment and loan recovery through:

### Core Requirements

1. **Alternative Credit Scoring Engine**
    - Analyze non-traditional data sources (transaction patterns, digital footprint, behavioral signals)
    - Real-time risk scoring with explainable AI decisions
    - Dynamic credit limit adjustments based on repayment behavior
2. **Intelligent Recovery Orchestration**
    - Multi-channel engagement (SMS, WhatsApp, Email, Voice AI)
    - Personalized repayment plans using ML-driven segmentation
    - Automated negotiation workflows with configurable escalation rules
3. **Fraud Detection Pipeline**
    - Real-time anomaly detection on applications
    - Pattern recognition for organized fraud rings
    - Document verification using computer vision
4. **Operations Dashboard**
    - Live monitoring of approval rates, default predictions, and recovery performance
    - A/B testing framework for collection strategies
    - Compliance reporting and audit trails

## Technical Requirements

Your solution **MUST** incorporate:

### AI/ML Components

- **RAG System**: Query regulatory compliance documents and lending policies
- **ML Models**: Credit scoring, default prediction, optimal contact time prediction
- **Agents**: Autonomous collection agents that adapt communication style based on customer profile
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to banking APIs, credit bureaus, and payment gateways

### Advanced Features: Not necessary to have everything, but a minimum of 2-3

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time processing of loan applications and payment events
- **Queue System**: Async processing of credit checks, document verification, and notification delivery with DLQ for failed operations
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed credit scores and customer profiles with TTL-based invalidation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect external API calls to credit bureaus
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures when third-party services are down
- **Idempotency**: Ensure safe retries for payment processing and loan disbursements
- **Distributed Transactions**: Implement the Saga pattern for the multi-step loan approval workflow
- **Sharding**: Partition customer data by geographic region for compliance and performance
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing for debugging

### Functional Requirements

**Deliverables:**

1. **Credit Assessment Module**
    - REST API for loan application submission
    - ML model serving endpoint for risk scoring
    - Integration with at least 2 data sources (mock or real)
2. **Recovery Automation**
    - Schedule and send personalized recovery messages
    - Track engagement metrics and payment promises
    - Escalation workflow with human handoff rules
3. **Admin Dashboard**
    - Real-time metrics visualization
    - Configure risk thresholds and collection strategies
    - Export compliance reports
4. **Performance Targets**
    - Handle 100 concurrent loan applications
    - Sub-second response time for credit decisions
    - 99.9% uptime for critical services

## Sample Scenarios to Handle

1. **New-to-Credit User**: 22-year-old with no credit history but consistent UPI transactions
2. **Seasonal Income**: Farmer with irregular income patterns requiring flexible repayment
3. **Strategic Defaulter**: Identifies customers with the ability but low willingness to pay
4. **Emergency Refinancing**: Auto-detect financial distress and offer restructuring

## Success Metrics

Your MVP should demonstrate:

- 20% improvement in approval rate without increasing default risk
- 15% increase in recovery rate through intelligent targeting
- 50% reduction in manual review time
- Real-time processing with <100ms P99 latency

## Bonus Challenges

- Implement explainable AI for regulatory compliance
- Multi-language support for collection messages
- Predictive analytics for early warning signals
- Integration with government databases for KYC verification

## Deployment Requirements

- Containerized microservices architecture
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Monitoring dashboard with key metrics
- Load testing results showing system limits
- Security measures, including encryption and API authentication

## Testing & Performance Evaluation

### Key Testing & Evaluation Requirements

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Achieve 80% unit test coverage with 100% on critical paths (payment processing, credit decisions). Include integration tests for all APIs, E2E user journeys, and ML model validation with bias detection and data drift monitoring.
- **Load & Performance Benchmarks**: System must handle 10,000 concurrent requests with P50 latency <50ms and P99 <500ms. Conduct stress testing to identify breaking points, 24-hour endurance tests for memory leaks, and chaos engineering to validate recovery from failures (network outages, service crashes, database issues).
- **LLM & AI Model Validation**: Test LLM responses for hallucination (<5% error rate), compliance adherence, and prompt injection resistance. Validate ML models achieve AUC-ROC >0.85 for credit scoring, ensure real-time inference <100ms, and implement A/B testing frameworks for continuous model improvement.
- **Security & Resilience Testing**: Execute OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessments, API penetration testing, and DDoS simulations. Validate circuit breakers trigger correctly, automatic failover works within 60 seconds, and data encryption is maintained throughout the pipeline.
- **Production Monitoring & Observability**: Implement distributed tracing for all requests, custom business metrics (approval rates, recovery rates), and real-time alerting for SLA violations. Performance test report must include load graphs, bottleneck analysis, and before/after optimization metrics demonstrating measurable improvements.

**Remember**: Focus on building a working system that demonstrates intelligent automation in fintech. The judges value practical solutions that could be extended into production systems. Good luck!

## How to run the model service and risk-score API

This project now includes a small Python service to serve the trained XGBoost model and a Next.js API route that proxies requests to it.

1) Start the Python model service (FastAPI)

```bash
# from repo root
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/model_service/requirements.txt
python backend/model_service/main.py
# Service runs at http://localhost:8000
```

2) Configure the frontend to call the model service

Create or update `frontend/.env.local` with:

```bash
MODEL_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

3) Use the scoring API from the app

- Next.js route: `POST /api/risk-score` expects the same JSON you submit in the loan form, and returns `{ predicted_class, probabilities, band, explanation, features_used }`.
- Existing loan application submission (`POST /api/loan-application`) is unchanged; scoring is currently exposed separately to avoid breaking any existing flows.
